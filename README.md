# Portfolio

## Starting this site
* Clone the site and run npm install
* Npm start will start the server
* npm run watch-css will start watching your sass files for changes.

## About the site
* Remade this portfolio in react to make adding projects easier. I created a project component along with an external json file that contains all the project data. I map over this json data and drop all the necessary props into the project component to ease updating the projects page. 
* I also take advantage of netlifys form submission ability to keep this a strictly static site.
